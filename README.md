# JS4B - Homework - Day 1

### Part 1: Variables

1. Declare a variable `myFavoriteNumber` and store your favorite number. Remember, you store values with `let` if the values may change later, and `const` if the value isn't expected to change.

`const name = Kyle;`
`let age = 41;`

2. Declare another variable `someOtherNumber` and store any other number you like.

3. Multiply the two variables together and store in a new variable `multipliedNumbers`.

4. Declare a variable `firstName` and store your first name.

5. Declare a variable `lastName` and store your last name.

6. Declare a variable `fullName` and store in it the value you get by adding `firstName` and `lastName`.

7. Declare a variable `myDetails` and assign an `object` to it. Store your `firstName`, `lastName`, `favColor` and `hometown` as keys inside the object.

8. Declare a variable `myBio`, then using dot notation to access the data from the `myDetails` object you just created, store a short bio about yourself. `myBio` should be a string that reads like: "Hi, my name is Luke Skywalker. I am from Tatooine and my favorite color is green."

9. Declare a variable `dreamDestinations`, then using an `array`, store a list of the top 5 places you want to visit.

### Part 2: Loops

10. Write a loop that prints 'hello' to the console 10 times. (Note: `console.log()` is a built-in function that prints out whatever input we give it.)

11. The variable `count` has be provided and set to 0. Then write a `while` loop that that adds 1 to `count` 100 times. After the loop, print the new value of count to the console.

12. Write a loop to print only the even numbers between 1 and 100

13. Using a `for` loop, iterate through your `dreamDestinations` array and print "One day soon, I will visit {your destination here}" for each destination

### BONUS
Iteration with a twist

14. Create a `for` loop that iterates over an array. On the first iteration the loop will log to the console the fist element in the array and the last element. On the second iteration the loop will log to the console the 2nd element in the array and the second to the last element. This process will continue until all the element in the array are logged.

15. Create a `for` loop that iterates over an array and logs to the console the first element in the array and then every 3rd element. Here is the twist though... You are not allowed to use the Division (/) or Modulus (%) operators.

Enjoy the Rest of Your Week!

Look at you! You did it! I hope you had a little bit of fun along the way.
